    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Classification model: emails labelled spam or not spam</h3>
            <h4>June 2022 - July 2022</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Under Professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University, California. Based on certain features found usually in
                    spam folders, teaching the machine to classify or label future mails as spam or not. The margin of error was
                    kept less than 2%.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><h3>Yelp Dataset: Capstone Project</h3>
            <h4>May 2022 - June 2022</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Working with a SQLite DBMS for Chinook Database and creating my own business oriented queries as well as solutions
                    in the stipulated database under the Yelp Dataset.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><h3>Linear and Logistic Regression model: Housing Prices prediction model</h3>
            <h4>May 2022 - July 2022</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Under Professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University, California. Based on certain accurate training examples of older
                housing prices provided to the model, it was trained to predict future hosuing prices with a margin og error between 1% and 2.3%.
                Nearly 250,000 inputs were used to precisely train the model.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><h3>CO2 Emissions across the globe: Data Analysis and Visualization</h3>
            <h4>November 2022</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The CO2 emissions data on global scale were obtained through public records available on BigQuery Sandbox. The data was cleaned,
                    processed and analyzed thoroughly. The conclusive results were then plotted on graphs and were also depicted on Tableau Dashboard
                    highlighting countries producing CO2 emissions in descending order using color contrast scales.
